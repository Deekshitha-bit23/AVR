# Production Head Card Layout - FIXED

## Issues Fixed

### Problem
The current output showed project details spread across multiple lines instead of a clean, single-line layout as in the reference screenshot.

### Solution Applied

#### 1. Card Structure Now Matches Reference Exactly

**Top Row:**
```
Project Name (Left) | Status Badge + Edit Icon (Right)
```

**Description (if available):**
```
Below project name, in gray, single line
```

**Single-Line Details:**
```
Budget | Date | Members
```

**Days Left:**
```
Bottom right corner in green text
```

#### 2. Layout Changes Made

**Before:**
- Details were wrapped in multiple nested Rows
- Icons and text could break into separate lines
- Layout was inconsistent

**After:**
- Single Row container with all elements
- Horizontal arrangement with proper spacing
- All details (₹, date, members) stay on ONE line
- Icons inline with text (not in separate rows)

#### 3. Key Improvements

✅ **Single-Line Layout**: Budget, date, and members now display on ONE line
✅ **Proper Spacing**: 16dp between major elements, 4dp between icons and text
✅ **Description Placement**: Shows below project name, not mixed with status badge
✅ **Color-Coded Icons**: 
   - ₹ in green (#4CAF50)
   - 📅 in blue (#42A5F5)  
   - 👤 in purple (#9C27B0)
✅ **Days Left**: Right-aligned at bottom in green (or red if overdue)
✅ **Card Layout**: Matches exact iOS reference structure

#### 4. Exact Element Order in Card

```kotlin
Column {
    // Row 1: Name + Badge + Edit Icon
    Row {
        Text(project.name) // Left
        Row { Badge + Edit } // Right
    }
    
    // Description (if exists)
    if (description) {
        Text(description) // Gray, below name
    }
    
    Spacer(12dp)
    
    // Row 2: Single-line details
    Row {
        Text("₹") + Amount + 
        Spacer(16dp) +
        Icon + Date +
        Spacer(16dp) +
        Icon + Members
    }
    
    // Row 3: Days left (right-aligned)
    Row {
        AlignEnd()
        Text("X days left") // Green/Red
    }
}
```

### 5. Text Formatting

- **Project Name**: 20sp, bold, black
- **Description**: 14sp, gray, maxLines=1
- **Details (₹, date, members)**: 14sp, gray, normal weight
- **Days Left**: 14sp, medium weight, green/red

### 6. Icon Sizes
- All icons: 16dp
- Edit icon: 18dp  
- Status dot: 8dp

### 7. Spacing Values
- Between header elements: 8dp
- Between name and description: 8dp
- Between description and details: 12dp
- Between detail elements (₹, date, members): 16dp
- Between icons and their text: 4dp
- Card padding: 20dp
- Card margin: 16dp horizontal

## Visual Comparison

### BEFORE (Current Output):
```
Project Name
Status Badge | Edit
Description (if any)

₹ Budget Amount  ← Separate line
📅 Date Range    ← Separate line  
👤 Members       ← Separate line

X days left
```

### AFTER (Fixed):
```
Project Name                Status Badge | Edit
Description (if any)

₹ Amount   📅 Date   👤 Members     ← ALL ON ONE LINE

                                X days left
```
