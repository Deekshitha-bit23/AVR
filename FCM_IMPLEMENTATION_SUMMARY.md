# FCM Implementation Summary

## üéØ Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive FCM notification system that uses stored FCM tokens from the users collection to send targeted push notifications for expense submissions and approvals. The system maintains all existing functionalities while adding robust push notification capabilities.

## ‚úÖ Implemented Features

### 1. **FCM Token Management**
- **Automatic Token Collection**: FCM tokens are automatically collected and stored when users log in
- **Token Storage**: Tokens are stored in `users` collection under `deviceInfo.fcmToken` field
- **Token Updates**: Tokens are automatically updated when new tokens are generated
- **Token Retrieval**: System can retrieve FCM tokens for any user by their user ID

### 2. **Notification Flow**
- **Expense Submission**: When a user submits an expense, FCM notifications are sent to all project approvers and production heads
- **Expense Approval/Rejection**: When a manager approves/rejects an expense, FCM notification is sent to the user who submitted the expense
- **Dual Notification System**: Both FCM push notifications and in-app Firestore notifications are sent

### 3. **Service Architecture**
- **FCMNotificationService**: New service for handling FCM-specific operations
- **NotificationService**: Enhanced to integrate with FCM service
- **FCMService**: Updated to automatically update FCM tokens in Firestore
- **AuthRepository**: Added `getUserById` method for FCM token retrieval

## üîß Technical Implementation

### **New Files Created:**
1. `FCMNotificationService.kt` - Core FCM notification service
2. `FCM_NOTIFICATION_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Comprehensive implementation guide
3. `FCM_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - This summary document

### **Files Modified:**
1. `NotificationService.kt` - Integrated FCM notifications
2. `FCMService.kt` - Enhanced token management
3. `AuthRepository.kt` - Added getUserById method
4. `AppModule.kt` - Added dependency injection for new services

### **Files Removed:**
1. `DeviceNotificationService.kt` - Replaced by FCMNotificationService

## üì± Notification Types Supported

### **Expense-Related Notifications:**
- `EXPENSE_SUBMITTED` - Sent to approvers when expense is submitted
- `EXPENSE_APPROVED` - Sent to user when expense is approved
- `EXPENSE_REJECTED` - Sent to user when expense is rejected

### **Project-Related Notifications:**
- `PROJECT_ASSIGNMENT` - Sent when user is assigned to project
- `PENDING_APPROVAL` - Sent to production heads for pending approvals

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema

### **Users Collection Structure:**
```json
{
  "uid": "user_123",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "phone": "9876543210",
  "role": "USER",
  "deviceInfo": {
    "fcmToken": "FCM_TOKEN_HERE",
    "deviceId": "DEVICE_ID",
    "deviceModel": "Samsung Galaxy S21",
    "osVersion": "Android 12",
    "appVersion": "1.0.0",
    "lastLoginAt": 1640995200000,
    "isOnline": true
  },
  "notificationPreferences": {
    "pushNotifications": true,
    "expenseSubmitted": true,
    "expenseApproved": true,
    "expenseRejected": true,
    "projectAssignment": true,
    "pendingApprovals": true
  }
}
```

## üîÑ Notification Flow Examples

### **Expense Submission Flow:**
1. User submits expense in `AddExpenseScreen`
2. `ExpenseViewModel.submitExpense()` is called
3. `sendExpenseSubmissionNotifications()` is triggered
4. `NotificationService.sendExpenseSubmissionNotification()` is called
5. FCM notifications are sent to all project approvers and production heads
6. In-app notifications are created in Firestore

### **Expense Approval Flow:**
1. Manager approves expense in `ReviewExpenseScreen`
2. `ApprovalViewModel.approveExpense()` is called
3. `sendExpenseStatusNotification()` is triggered
4. FCM notification is sent to the expense submitter
5. In-app notification is created in Firestore

## üöÄ Key Features

### **1. Automatic FCM Token Management**
```kotlin
// FCM tokens are automatically updated when new tokens are generated
override fun onNewToken(token: String) {
    // Updates token in Firestore for current user
}
```

### **2. Targeted Notifications**
```kotlin
// Send notification to specific user
fcmNotificationService.sendNotificationToUser(
    userId = "user_123",
    title = "Expense Approved",
    message = "Your expense has been approved"
)

// Send notification to multiple users
fcmNotificationService.sendNotificationToUsers(
    userIds = listOf("user_1", "user_2"),
    title = "New Expense",
    message = "New expense requires approval"
)
```

### **3. Role-Based Notifications**
```kotlin
// Send notification to all users with specific role
fcmNotificationService.sendNotificationToUsersByRole(
    role = UserRole.APPROVER,
    title = "Pending Approvals",
    message = "You have expenses awaiting approval"
)
```

## üîß Configuration Required

### **1. FCM Server Key**
Replace `YOUR_FCM_SERVER_KEY` in `FCMNotificationService.kt` with your actual FCM server key from Firebase Console.

### **2. Firebase Configuration**
Ensure your `google-services.json` file is properly configured with FCM settings.

## üìä Performance Optimizations

### **Implemented Optimizations:**
- **Background Processing**: All FCM operations run on background threads
- **Batch Notifications**: Multiple notifications are sent efficiently
- **Error Handling**: Failed notifications don't block the main flow
- **Token Caching**: FCM tokens are cached for faster access
- **Network Resilience**: Proper error handling for network failures

## üîê Security Features

### **Security Measures:**
- **User Validation**: Notifications are only sent to valid users
- **Permission Checks**: Role-based notification filtering
- **Content Sanitization**: Notification content is properly formatted
- **Secure Token Storage**: FCM tokens are stored securely in Firestore

## üß™ Testing Recommendations

### **Test Scenarios:**
1. **Expense Submission**: Verify approvers receive FCM notifications
2. **Expense Approval**: Verify submitter receives FCM notification
3. **Token Updates**: Verify FCM token is updated on app restart
4. **Offline Behavior**: Test notification behavior when offline
5. **Multiple Devices**: Test notifications across different devices

### **Test Commands:**
```bash
# Check FCM logs
adb logcat | grep FCMNotificationService

# Test notification delivery
adb shell am broadcast -a com.google.firebase.MESSAGING_EVENT
```
