# Delegation Auto-Removal Implementation

## Overview

This implementation provides automatic removal of team members from projects when their delegation assignment expires. The system ensures that expired delegations are processed automatically and users no longer see projects they were temporarily assigned to after the end date.

## Key Features

### 1. Automatic Delegation Expiry Processing
- **Background Service**: `DelegationExpiryService` automatically checks for expired delegations
- **Scheduled Execution**: Runs every 6 hours using WorkManager to process expired delegations
- **Real-time Filtering**: Project lists are filtered to exclude projects with expired delegations

### 2. Team Member Removal
- **Automatic Removal**: Team members are automatically removed from project's `teamMembers` list when delegation expires
- **Database Cleanup**: Temporary approver assignments are deactivated and marked as expired
- **Project Cleanup**: Temporary approver phone numbers are removed from project documents

### 3. User Notification
- **Expiry Notifications**: Users receive notifications when their delegation expires
- **Clear Messaging**: Notifications explain that the user has been automatically removed from the project

## Implementation Components

### 1. DelegationExpiryService
**Location**: `app/src/main/java/com/deeksha/avr/service/DelegationExpiryService.kt`

**Key Methods**:
- `processExpiredDelegations()`: Processes all expired delegations across all projects
- `processExpiredDelegationsForProject(projectId)`: Processes expired delegations for a specific project
- `removeTeamMemberFromProject(projectId, teamMemberId)`: Removes team member from project's teamMembers list
- `deactivateTemporaryApprover(projectId, expiredApprover)`: Deactivates expired temporary approver assignment

**Features**:
- Comprehensive logging for debugging
- Error handling and recovery
- Batch processing of multiple projects
- Individual project processing

### 2. DelegationScheduler
**Location**: `app/src/main/java/com/deeksha/avr/service/DelegationScheduler.kt`

**Key Methods**:
- `scheduleDelegationExpiryChecks()`: Schedules periodic delegation expiry checks
- `runDelegationExpiryCheckNow()`: Runs immediate delegation expiry check
- `cancelDelegationExpiryChecks()`: Cancels scheduled checks
- `isDelegationExpiryScheduled()`: Checks if delegation expiry checks are scheduled

**Features**:
- WorkManager integration for reliable background processing
- Network and battery constraints
- Unique work scheduling to prevent duplicates
- Flexible scheduling options

### 3. DelegationExpiryWorker
**Location**: `app/src/main/java/com/deeksha/avr/worker/DelegationExpiryWorker.kt`

**Features**:
- Hilt integration for dependency injection
- Coroutine-based background processing
- Proper error handling and result reporting
- WorkManager lifecycle management

### 4. Enhanced Project Filtering
**Location**: `app/src/main/java/com/deeksha/avr/repository/ProjectRepository.kt`

**Key Changes**:
- Added `isDelegationActiveForUser()` method to check delegation status
- Updated `getTemporaryApproverProjects()` to filter out expired delegations
- Real-time filtering ensures users only see active delegations

**Filtering Logic**:
1. Get all projects where user is temporary approver
2. Filter out rejected assignments
3. Check if delegation is still active (not expired)
4. Return only projects with active delegations

### 5. Notification System
**Location**: `app/src/main/java/com/deeksha/avr/service/NotificationService.kt`

**New Method**:
- `sendDelegationExpiryNotification()`: Sends notification when delegation expires

**Notification Type**:
- Added `DELEGATION_EXPIRED` to `NotificationType` enum
- Informational notification (no action required)
- Clear messaging about automatic removal

### 6. Database Schema Updates
**TemporaryApprover Model**:
- Enhanced with `isExpired()` helper function
- Status tracking for expired delegations
- Proper date comparison logic

**Project Model**:
- Team members list is automatically updated when delegations expire
- Temporary approver phone is removed when delegation expires

## Workflow

### 1. Delegation Assignment
1. Production head assigns temporary approver with start and end dates
2. User accepts the delegation
3. User is added to project's `teamMembers` list
4. Project appears in user's project selection

### 2. Delegation Expiry Processing
1. Background worker runs every 6 hours
2. Service checks all projects for expired delegations
3. For each expired delegation:
   - Remove user from project's `teamMembers` list
   - Deactivate temporary approver assignment
   - Remove temporary approver phone from project
   - Send expiry notification to user

### 3. Project Filtering
1. When user requests project list
2. System checks delegation status for each project
3. Only projects with active delegations are returned
4. Expired delegations are automatically filtered out

## Configuration

### Scheduling
- **Frequency**: Every 6 hours
- **Flexibility**: 1-hour flex interval
- **Constraints**: Requires network connection and sufficient battery
- **Persistence**: Survives app restarts and device reboots

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive logging for debugging
- Graceful error recovery
- Safe fallbacks (return false on errors)
- Detailed error messages

## Testing

### Manual Testing
1. Create a project with temporary approver
2. Set end date to current time or past
3. Wait for background processing or trigger manually
4. Verify user is removed from project team
5. Verify project no longer appears in user's project list
6. Verify notification is sent

### Automated Testing
- Unit tests for delegation expiry logic
- Integration tests for background processing
- UI tests for project filtering

## Benefits

### 1. Automatic Cleanup
- No manual intervention required
- Prevents stale project assignments
- Maintains data integrity

### 2. User Experience
- Clear notifications about expiry
- Automatic removal from expired projects
- Clean project selection interface

### 3. System Reliability
- Background processing with WorkManager
- Error handling and recovery
- Comprehensive logging

### 4. Performance
- Efficient batch processing
- Real-time filtering
- Minimal resource usage

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Advanced Scheduling
- Configurable check intervals
- Smart scheduling based on activity
- Priority-based processing

### 2. Enhanced Notifications
- Reminder notifications before expiry
- Escalation for critical projects
- Custom notification templates

### 3. Analytics
- Delegation expiry tracking
- Usage statistics
- Performance metrics

### 4. Admin Controls
- Manual delegation management
- Bulk operations
- Override capabilities

## Dependencies

### New Dependencies Added
- `androidx.work:work-runtime-ktx:2.9.0`
- `androidx.hilt:hilt-work:1.1.0`

### Existing Dependencies Used
- Firebase Firestore
- Hilt for dependency injection
- Coroutines for async processing
- Android WorkManager

## Security Considerations

### 1. Data Integrity
- Atomic operations for team member removal
- Proper error handling to prevent data corruption
- Validation of delegation status before processing

### 2. Access Control
- Only system can remove team members automatically
- Proper authorization checks
- Audit trail for all changes

### 3. Privacy
- Notifications only sent to affected users
- No sensitive data in logs
- Proper data cleanup

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### 1. Logging
- Comprehensive debug logging
- Error tracking and reporting
- Performance metrics

### 2. Health Checks
- WorkManager status monitoring
- Service health verification
- Database consistency checks

### 3. Maintenance
- Regular cleanup of old data
- Performance optimization
- Error analysis and fixes

This implementation provides a robust, automated solution for managing delegation expiry that ensures data integrity, improves user experience, and maintains system reliability.
