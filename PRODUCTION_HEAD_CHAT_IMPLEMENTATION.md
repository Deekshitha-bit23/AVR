# Production Head Chat Implementation

## Problem
The project had **"Production Heads: 0"** in the project data, so the Production Head wasn't appearing in the chat list for End User and Approver flows.

## Solution
Added a fallback mechanism to fetch the Production Head by their role directly from the users collection, since there will be only one Production Head in the system.

## Changes Made

### 1. ChatRepository.kt

#### Added Production Head Fallback Logic
```kotlin
// Add Production Head if not already in the list
val productionHead = getProductionHeadByRole()
if (productionHead != null && !allMemberIds.contains(productionHead.userId)) {
    members.add(productionHead)
    Log.d("ChatRepository", "Added Production Head by role: ${productionHead.name} (${productionHead.role})")
}
```

#### Added Helper Function
```kotlin
private suspend fun getProductionHeadByRole(): ChatMember? {
    return try {
        Log.d("ChatRepository", "Fetching Production Head by role...")
        val querySnapshot = usersCollection
            .whereEqualTo("role", "PRODUCTION_HEAD")
            .get()
            .await()
        
        if (!querySnapshot.isEmpty) {
            val document = querySnapshot.documents.first()
            val userData = document.data
            
            if (userData != null) {
                val deviceInfoData = userData["deviceInfo"] as? Map<*, *>
                val isOnline = deviceInfoData?.get("isOnline") as? Boolean ?: false
                val lastLoginAt = deviceInfoData?.get("lastLoginAt") as? Long ?: 0L
                
                val member = ChatMember(
                    userId = document.id,
                    name = userData["name"] as? String ?: "Unknown",
                    phone = userData["phone"] as? String ?: "",
                    role = UserRole.PRODUCTION_HEAD,
                    isOnline = isOnline,
                    lastSeen = lastLoginAt
                )
                
                Log.d("ChatRepository", "Found Production Head: ${member.name} (${member.userId})")
                member
            } else null
        } else {
            Log.w("ChatRepository", "No Production Head found in users collection")
            null
        }
    } catch (e: Exception) {
        Log.e("ChatRepository", "Error fetching Production Head by role: ${e.message}", e)
        null
    }
}
```

#### Updated Logging
```kotlin
Log.d("ChatRepository", "Project data - Approvers: ${projectData.approverIds.size}, " +
        "Production Heads (from project): ${projectData.productionHeadIds.size}, " +
        "Team Members: ${projectData.teamMembers.size}, " +
        "Manager: ${projectData.managerId}")
```

## How It Works

### 1. Primary Method (Project Assignment)
- First tries to get Production Head from project's `productionHeadIds` array
- This is the preferred method when Production Head is assigned to specific projects

### 2. Fallback Method (Role-Based)
- If no Production Head found in project data, queries users collection by role
- Searches for any user with `role = "PRODUCTION_HEAD"`
- Adds the Production Head to the team members list
- Prevents duplicates by checking if already in the list

### 3. Display
- Production Head appears with **purple color** and **"Production Head"** label
- Shows online/offline status and last seen time
- Appears in both End User and Approver chat lists

## Expected Log Output

After the fix, you should see:
```
ChatRepository: Project data - Approvers: 0, Production Heads (from project): 0, Team Members: 3, Manager: 9449341157
ChatRepository: Fetching Production Head by role...
ChatRepository: Found Production Head: [Name] ([Phone])
ChatRepository: Added Production Head by role: [Name] (PRODUCTION_HEAD)
ChatRepository: Total members fetched: 4
```

## Benefits

1. **Always Shows Production Head**: Even if not assigned to specific project
2. **No Duplicates**: Checks if already in list before adding
3. **Role-Based**: Works by user role, not project assignment
4. **Consistent**: Same behavior for all user flows (End User, Approver, Production Head)
5. **Fallback Safe**: If Production Head not found, doesn't break the flow

## Testing

The Production Head should now appear in the chat list with:
- ✅ **Purple color** (Color(0xFF9C27B0))
- ✅ **"Production Head"** label
- ✅ **Online/offline status**
- ✅ **Last seen time**
- ✅ **Clickable to start chat**

## Files Modified

1. **ChatRepository.kt** - Added Production Head fallback logic and helper function

## Conclusion

The Production Head will now always appear in the chat list for both End User and Approver flows, regardless of whether they're assigned to the specific project or not. This ensures consistent communication access across all user roles.
