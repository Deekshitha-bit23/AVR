# Project-Based Notification Filtering Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented project-based notification filtering to ensure that users with `UserRole.USER` only receive notifications for projects specifically allotted to them. This addresses the requirement: *"user role should get only team member assignment of that particular user and the approvals and rejection notification of that project alloted to him"*.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced NotificationService.kt

**Added Project Assignment Validation:**
- Implemented `isUserAssignedToProject()` function that checks user role and project assignment
- **USER Role**: Validates against `user.assignedProjects` list
- **APPROVER Role**: Validates against project's `approverIds` or `managerId`
- **PRODUCTION_HEAD Role**: Validates against project's `productionHeadIds`
- **ADMIN Role**: Always returns true (full access)

**Modified Notification Methods:**
- `sendExpenseStatusNotification()`: Now validates user assignment before sending
- `sendProjectAssignmentNotification()`: Enhanced with FCM notifications
- `sendPendingApprovalNotification()`: Added FCM notifications for production heads

### 2. Enhanced FCMNotificationService.kt

**Added Project Filtering:**
- `sendNotificationToUser()`: Now validates project assignment
- `sendNotificationToUsersByRoleWithProjectFilter()`: New method for role-based filtering
- Enhanced logging for debugging and monitoring

**Dependency Updates:**
- Added `ProjectRepository` dependency for project validation
- Updated constructor to include project repository

### 3. Updated Dependency Injection

**AppModule.kt Changes:**
- Updated `provideFCMNotificationService()` to include `ProjectRepository`
- Ensures proper dependency injection for project validation

## Security Features Implemented

### 1. Role-Based Access Control
- **USER**: Only notifications for assigned projects
- **APPROVER**: Notifications for projects they approve
- **PRODUCTION_HEAD**: Notifications for projects they manage
- **ADMIN**: All project notifications

### 2. Project Assignment Validation
- Validates user assignment before sending notifications
- Prevents unauthorized access to project information
- Maintains data privacy and confidentiality

### 3. Comprehensive Logging
- Tracks notification filtering decisions
- Logs unauthorized access attempts
- Provides debugging information

## Notification Types with Filtering

### 1. Expense Approval/Rejection Notifications
```kotlin
// Only sends if user is assigned to the project
notificationService.sendExpenseStatusNotification(
    expenseId = "expense123",
    projectId = "project1",
    submittedByUserId = "user123",
    isApproved = true,
    amount = 1500.0,
    reviewerName = "Manager Name"
)
```

### 2. Project Assignment Notifications
```kotlin
// Only sends to the specific assigned user
notificationService.sendProjectAssignmentNotification(
    projectId = "project1",
    userId = "user123",
    assignedRole = "Team Member"
)
```

### 3. FCM Notifications with Project Filtering
```kotlin
// Only sends to USER role users assigned to the project
fcmNotificationService.sendNotificationToUsersByRoleWithProjectFilter(
    role = UserRole.USER,
    title = "New Project Update",
    message = "Project has been updated",
    projectId = "project1",
    notificationType = "PROJECT_UPDATE"
)
```

## Database Requirements

### User Collection Structure
```json
{
  "uid": "user123",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "role": "USER",
  "assignedProjects": ["project1", "project2", "project3"],
  "deviceInfo": {
    "fcmToken": "fcm_token_here"
  }
}
```

### Project Collection Structure
```json
{
  "id": "project1",
  "name": "Mobile App Development",
  "managerId": "manager123",
  "approverIds": ["approver1", "approver2"],
  "productionHeadIds": ["prodhead1"],
  "teamMembers": ["user1", "user2", "user3"]
}
```

## Benefits Achieved

### 1. Data Privacy
- Users only receive notifications for projects they have access to
- Prevents information leakage to unauthorized users
- Maintains project confidentiality

### 2. Security Enhancement
- Role-based notification filtering
- Project-specific access validation
- Prevents unauthorized notification delivery

### 3. Scalability
- Efficient filtering and validation
- Comprehensive logging for monitoring
- Flexible architecture for future enhancements

### 4. User Experience
- Relevant notifications only
- Reduced notification noise
- Clear project-specific context

## Testing Recommendations

### 1. Unit Testing
- Test `isUserAssignedToProject()` with different user roles
- Test notification filtering logic
- Test FCM token validation

### 2. Integration Testing
- Test end-to-end notification flow
- Test project assignment validation
- Test role-based filtering

### 3. Manual Testing
- Verify notifications are only sent to assigned users
- Verify unauthorized users don't receive notifications
- Verify logging provides adequate debugging information

## Monitoring and Debugging

### 1. Log Examples
```
✅ User is assigned to project Mobile App Development
⚠️ User John Doe (user123) is not assigned to project project1
⚠️ Skipping notification to prevent unauthorized access
✅ FCM notification sent to expense submitter
```

### 2. Debug Steps
1. Check user's `assignedProjects` list
2. Verify project's role assignments
3. Review notification service logs
4. Check FCM token availability
5. Validate notification preferences

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Advanced Filtering
- Department-based filtering
- Category-based filtering
- Time-based filtering

### 2. Notification Preferences
- Granular notification settings per project
- Custom notification schedules
- Notification priority levels

### 3. Analytics
- Notification delivery tracking
- User engagement metrics
- Project-specific notification statistics

## Conclusion

The implementation successfully addresses the requirement for project-based notification filtering:

✅ **USER role users** only receive notifications for projects they are assigned to  
✅ **Security is maintained** by preventing unauthorized access to project information  
✅ **Scalability is achieved** through efficient filtering and validation  
✅ **Debugging is facilitated** through comprehensive logging  
✅ **Flexibility is provided** for future enhancements  

The system now ensures that notifications are properly filtered based on user roles and project assignments, maintaining data privacy while providing relevant notifications to authorized users.
