# Final Testing Guide - Role-Based Login

## Understanding the Two Scenarios

### Scenario 1: "CONTINUE" Button (Use Current Session)
**When to use:** You want to stay logged in as the current user

**What happens:**
- You click "CONTINUE" 
- App uses the **cached session**
- Shows whatever role is currently logged in
- **Does NOT use the phone number you entered** (if a cached session exists)

**Example:**
- Cache has: Production Head
- You enter: 6360090611 (USER)
- Click: "CONTINUE"
- **Result:** Production Head screen (because CONTINUE uses cache)

### Scenario 2: "LOGOUT" Then Fresh Login (Switch Roles)
**When to use:** You want to test a DIFFERENT role

**What happens:**
1. Click "LOGOUT" ‚Üí Clears Firebase session
2. Enter phone: 6360090611
3. Click "Send OTP" or "Development Skip"
4. **NOW** it uses the phone number you entered
5. Shows correct role based on phone number

**Example:**
- Cache has: Production Head
- Click: "LOGOUT"
- Enter: 6360090611 (USER)
- Click: "Development Skip"
- **Result:** USER screen ‚úì
