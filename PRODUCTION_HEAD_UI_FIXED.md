# Production Head UI - Fixed Implementation

## Issue Identified
Production Head users were being redirected to the old `ProductionHeadProjectSelectionScreen` instead of the new two-tab UI (`ProductionHeadMainScreen`) that was implemented.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Navigation Routing (AppNavHost.kt)
Changed all Production Head login redirects to use `Screen.ProductionHeadDashboard.route` instead of `Screen.ProductionHeadProjectSelection.route`:

**Fixed locations:**
- Line 132: Main login navigation
- Line 198: Login screen navigation  
- Line 273: OTP verification navigation

**Before:**
```kotlin
navController.navigate(Screen.ProductionHeadProjectSelection.route)
```

**After:**
```kotlin
navController.navigate(Screen.ProductionHeadDashboard.route)
```

### 2. What Now Happens When Production Head Users Login

When a Production Head user successfully logs in, they are now redirected to **`ProductionHeadMainScreen`** which displays:

#### **Projects Tab** (First Tab)
- Shows "Your Projects" with project count
- Dynamic list of all projects with:
  - Project name and status badge (Active/Completed)
  - Project description
  - Budget (₹ format)
  - Date range
  - Members count
  - Days left calculation
  - Edit button
- Filter dropdown (All/Active/Completed)
- Floating Action Button (FAB) for creating new projects
- Menu and logout buttons in top bar

#### **User Management Tab** (Second Tab)  
- Large centered icon with multiple user avatars
- "User Management" title and description
- Three action cards:
  1. **Create New User** - Blue icon, person with plus
  2. **View All Users** - Green icon, multiple people
  3. **Role Management** - Purple icon, person with checkmark
- Each card navigates to its respective screen

### 3. Complete UI Implementation

All previously created screens are now properly integrated:

✅ **ProductionHeadMainScreen.kt** - Container with bottom tab navigation
✅ **ProductionHeadProjectsTab.kt** - Projects listing with iOS-style cards  
✅ **ProductionHeadUserManagementTab.kt** - User management hub
✅ **ViewAllUsersScreen.kt** - Complete user listing with filters
✅ **RoleManagementScreen.kt** - Role and permissions viewer
✅ **Navigation Routes** - All routes properly configured in AppNavHost.kt

## What Users Will See

### After Login:
1. Production Head users land on the new two-tab interface
2. **Projects Tab** (active by default) shows all their projects
3. **User Management Tab** shows the three management options
4. Bottom navigation bar switches between tabs
5. All features are accessible and working

### Project Cards Display:
- ✅ Project name and status badge (Active/Completed in color)
- ✅ Description if available
- ✅ Budget with green rupee icon
- ✅ Date range with calendar icon
- ✅ Members count with purple people icon

## Build Status
