# URGENT FIX - Cached Session Issue

## THE PROBLEM (What Your Logcat Shows)

Your logcat clearly shows:
```
Sending OTP to: +916360090611  ‚Üê You're trying to login as USER
BUT THEN...
Firebase user found: NpjWLM1SKqNC9Q96ne2AqtXpXe52
Firebase user authenticated: Prajwal SS Reddy  ‚Üê Old cached session
User role: PRODUCTION_HEAD, Phone: 9008826666  ‚Üê Wrong user!
```

**The app is ignoring your new login and using the old cached Firebase session!**

## THE SOLUTION (Do This NOW)

### Step 1: Force Stop the App
- Swipe away the app from recent apps
- OR long press app icon ‚Üí App info ‚Üí Force Stop

### Step 2: Launch the App Again
- Open the app
- You should see a **WARNING BANNER** at the top:
  ```
  ‚ö†Ô∏è Cached Session Active
  Prajwal SS Reddy (PRODUCTION_HEAD)
  [LOGOUT] button
  ```

### Step 3: Click the RED "LOGOUT" Button
- This will clear the Firebase session
- The warning banner will disappear

### Step 4: NOW Login Fresh
- Enter phone: **6360090611**
- Click "Development Skip" (or complete OTP)
- Should now route to USER screen ‚úì

## Alternative: Clear App Data (If Logout Doesn't Work)

If the logout button doesn't appear or doesn't work:

### On Device:
1. Go to **Settings**
2. **Apps** ‚Üí **AVR** (your app)
3. **Storage** ‚Üí **Clear Data**
4. Launch app again
5. Login with 6360090611

### Via ADB:
```bash
adb shell pm clear com.deeksha.avr
```

## How to Test Different Roles

### Testing USER Role:
1. **LOGOUT** first (always!)
2. Enter: 6360090611
3. Development Skip
4. Should see: USER project selection ‚úì

### Testing APPROVER Role:
1. **LOGOUT** first
2. Enter: (approver phone)
3. Development Skip
4. Should see: Approver project selection ‚úì

### Testing PRODUCTION_HEAD Role:
1. **LOGOUT** first
2. Enter: 9008826666 (or other prod head phone)
3. Development Skip
4. Should see: Production Head with Projects/User Management tabs ‚úì

## What Changed

### Before:
- Small text button "üö™ Logout Current Session"
- Easy to miss

### After:
- **Prominent warning banner** at top
- Shows currently cached user and role
- **Red LOGOUT button** - hard to miss
- Logs warning in console

## Expected Logcat After Logout

After clicking LOGOUT, you should see:
```
LoginScreen: üîÑ Logging out cached session
AuthViewModel: üîÑ Logging out user...
AuthViewModel: ‚ùå Setting unauthenticated state
```

Then after fresh login with 6360090611:
```
AuthViewModel: üßπ Clearing previous authentication state
AuthViewModel: ‚úÖ Firebase auth cleared
AuthRepository: üîç Querying Firestore for phone: '6360090611'
AuthRepository: üîç Raw role from database: 'USER'
AuthViewModel:    Role value: USER  ‚Üê CORRECT!
Navigation: üéØ Navigating to USER flow
Navigation: üöÄ Route: project_selection  ‚Üê CORRECT!
```

## Why This Happens

Firebase Auth caches login sessions. This is:
- ‚úÖ **Good for production** (users stay logged in)
- ‚ùå **Bad for testing** (old sessions interfere)

## Quick Checklist

Before testing each role:
- [ ] See the warning banner? ‚Üí Click LOGOUT
- [ ] No warning banner? ‚Üí Clear Logcat
- [ ] Enter phone number for the role you want to test
- [ ] Click Development Skip
- [ ] Check Logcat for "Role value: XXX"
- [ ] Verify correct screen appears

## Still Seeing Production Head Screen?

If you're still seeing the wrong screen after logout:

1. Share the **NEW** Logcat output after clicking LOGOUT
2. Look for these lines:
   - "Logging out cached session"
   - "Setting unauthenticated state"
   - "Role value: XXX"
3. Share what phone number you entered
4. Share what screen appeared

## Summary

**YOU MUST LOGOUT BEFORE TESTING DIFFERENT ROLES!**

The app automatically restores Firebase sessions. Always look for the warning banner and click LOGOUT before logging in with a different phone number.

---

**Build successful!** The prominent warning banner is ready. Force stop the app and launch it again to see the new logout UI.
