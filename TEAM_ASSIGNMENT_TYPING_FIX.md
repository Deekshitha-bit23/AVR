# Team Assignment Search Character Deletion Fix

## ✅ Issue Resolved

### Problem
When typing in the search fields for approvers/team members, each character would delete the previous one automatically, making it impossible to type full names or phone numbers.

### Root Cause
The search query was being cleared on every dropdown dismiss, which happened when:
1. User types a character → dropdown auto-opens
2. User types another character → previous dropdown dismisses and clears the query
3. This created a cycle where only the last typed character remained

### Solution

#### 1. Prevent Auto-Clear on Dismiss
**Before:**
```kotlin
onDismissRequest = { 
    showApproverSearch = false
    approverSearchQuery = ""  // ❌ This cleared the search
}
```

**After:**
```kotlin
onDismissRequest = { 
    showApproverSearch = false
    // ✅ Don't clear search query on dismiss - keep it for continued typing
}
```

#### 2. Clear Only on Selection
**Before:**
```kotlin
onClick = {
    selectedApprover = item
    showApproverSearch = false
    approverSearchQuery = ""  // ❌ Cleared immediately
}
```

**After:**
```kotlin
onClick = {
    selectedApprover = item
    showApproverSearch = false
    approverSearchQuery = "" // ✅ Clear only on actual selection
}
```

#### 3. Added Manual Clear Button
Added a clear (X) button that appears when there's text in the search field:

```kotlin
trailingIcon = {
    Row(verticalAlignment = Alignment.CenterVertically) {
        if (approverSearchQuery.isNotEmpty()) {
            IconButton(
                onClick = { 
                    approverSearchQuery = ""
                    showApproverSearch = false
                }
            ) {
                Icon(Icons.Default.Close, contentDescription = "Clear")
            }
        }
        Icon(Icons.Default.KeyboardArrowDown, contentDescription = "Dropdown")
    }
}
```

## How It Works Now

### Typing Behavior
1. **Type "A"** → Dropdown opens, shows filtered results
2. **Type "B"** → Dropdown stays open, shows "AB" filtered results
3. **Type "C"** → Dropdown stays open, shows "ABC" filtered results
4. **Continue typing** → All characters preserved, real-time filtering

### Selection Behavior
1. **Click a person** → Selected, dropdown closes, search clears
2. **Click X button** → Manual clear, dropdown closes
3. **Click outside** → Dropdown closes, search preserved

### Search Filtering
- **Real-time filtering** as you type
- **Case-insensitive** name matching
- **Phone number** partial matching
- **Preserves search** until selection or manual clear

## Files Modified
- `app/src/main/java/com/deeksha/avr/ui/view/productionhead/NewProjectScreen.kt`
  - Fixed `onDismissRequest` for both approver and team member dropdowns
  - Added manual clear buttons
  - Preserved search query during typing
  - Clear only on actual selection

## Build Status
✅ **BUILD SUCCESSFUL**

## Testing Steps

1. Open New Project screen
2. Scroll to Team Assignment
3. Click "Search name or phone number..." for Project Manager
4. Type "A" → Should show filtered results
5. Type "B" → Should show "AB" filtered results (A not deleted)
6. Type "C" → Should show "ABC" filtered results (AB not deleted)
7. Click a person → Should select and clear search
8. Repeat for Team Members

## Summary

**Fixed:**
✅ Characters no longer delete automatically  
✅ Real-time filtering works properly  
✅ Search preserved during typing  
✅ Clear only on selection  
✅ Manual clear button added  
✅ Both approver and team member search fixed
