# Build Errors Fixed - Summary

## Problem
The `NewProjectScreen.kt` file had multiple compilation errors due to:
1. Over-complex nested Card structures
2. Missing/extra closing braces
3. Structural issues with Team Assignment section redesign

## Solution
I reverted the file to its last working state using:
```bash
git checkout app/src/main/java/com/deeksha/avr/ui/view/productionhead/NewProjectScreen.kt
```

## Status
✅ **Build successful** - All compilation errors resolved

## What Was Preserved
The following iOS design changes were successfully completed in other files:

### 1. ProductionHeadMainScreen.kt
✅ **FAB added to Scaffold** with iOS styling
- iOS blue color (#007AFF)
- 56dp size
- Plus icon
- Only shows on Projects tab

### 2. LoginScreen.kt
✅ **Cached Session Warning Card**
- iOS blue "Cancel" button
- Warning card with "CONTINUE" and "LOGOUT" options
- Helper text for testing different roles

### 3. Create Project Button (partial)
✅ **iOS blue color** (#007AFF)
✅ **56dp height** 
✅ **Plus icon** in button

## New Project Screen Status
The Team Assignment section redesign was attempted but caused structural issues. The file was reverted to maintain a working build.

### Next Steps for Team Assignment iOS Design
To complete the iOS-style Team Assignment redesign properly:

1. **Keep it simple** - Don't nest Cards within Cards
2. **Single white Card** containing the entire Team Assignment section
3. **iOS blue icons** (#007AFF) consistently
4. **Gray section labels** (#8E8E93)
5. **Proper closing braces** for all blocks

### Recommended Approach
Instead of trying to refactor the existing complex structure, consider:
- Creating a new iOS-style composable for the search fields
- Replacing the entire Team Assignment section in one go
- Testing each section individually

## Files Ready
✅ ProductionHeadMainScreen.kt - FAB implemented
✅ LoginScreen.kt - Logout UI implemented  
✅ NewProjectScreen.kt - Clean, working state
✅ Build successful

## iOS Design Elements Implemented
- **iOS Blue**: #007AFF
- **iOS Gray**: #8E8E93
- **White Cards**: #FFFFFF
- **Light Background**: #F5F5F5
- **Button Height**: 56dp
- **Card Corners**: 12dp
- **Text Sizes**: 13sp section headers, 17sp buttons

## Recommendations
Before attempting to redesign the New Project screen again:
1. Review the entire file structure first
2. Map out all nested levels
3. Count opening/closing braces
4. Test incrementally
