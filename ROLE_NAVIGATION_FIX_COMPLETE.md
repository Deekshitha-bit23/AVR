# Role-Based Navigation Fix - Complete Solution

## Problem Summary
Users with USER and APPROVER roles were seeing the Production Head screen instead of their respective screens when using the development skip (direct login without OTP).

## Root Cause
**Cached authentication state** was persisting from previous logins. When a user previously logged in as PRODUCTION_HEAD, that role was cached and not properly cleared when using development skip.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Clear Previous Authentication State (AuthViewModel.kt)
Added comprehensive state clearing at the start of `skipOTPForDevelopment`:

```kotlin
// IMPORTANT: Clear any previous authentication state first
Log.d("AuthViewModel", "üßπ Clearing previous authentication state")

// Sign out from Firebase to clear any cached authentication
try {
    authRepository.signOut()
    Log.d("AuthViewModel", "‚úÖ Firebase auth cleared")
} catch (e: Exception) {
    Log.w("AuthViewModel", "‚ö†Ô∏è Failed to clear Firebase auth: ${e.message}")
}

_authState.value = _authState.value.copy(isAuthenticated = false, user = null, isLoading = false, error = null)
_currentUser.value = null
_isDevelopmentSkipUser.value = false
_hasCompletedVerification.value = false
```

### 2. Enhanced Logging
Added detailed logging to track role detection and navigation:

```kotlin
Log.d("AuthViewModel", "‚úÖ Found actual user in database")
Log.d("AuthViewModel", "   Name: ${actualUser.name}")
Log.d("AuthViewModel", "   Phone: ${actualUser.phone}")
Log.d("AuthViewModel", "   Role from DB: ${actualUser.role}")
Log.d("AuthViewModel", "   Role type: ${actualUser.role.javaClass.simpleName}")
Log.d("AuthViewModel", "   Role value: ${actualUser.role.name}")
```

### 3. Improved Navigation Logging
Added role-based navigation logs in `AppNavHost.kt`:

```kotlin
android.util.Log.d("AppNavHost", "üéØ Auth state changed - isAuthenticated: ${authState.isAuthenticated}, user: ${user.name} (${user.phone}), role: ${user.role}")
android.util.Log.d("AppNavHost", "üéØ Processing role navigation for role: $role")
android.util.Log.d("AppNavHost", "üéØ Navigating USER to ProjectSelection route: ${Screen.ProjectSelection.route}")
```

## Files Modified

### 1. `app/src/main/java/com/deeksha/avr/viewmodel/AuthViewModel.kt`
- Clear previous authentication state before development skip
- Sign out from Firebase to clear cached auth
- Enhanced logging for role detection
- Detailed role value tracking

### 2. `app/src/main/java/com/deeksha/avr/navigation/AppNavHost.kt`
- Added phone number logging
- Enhanced role navigation logging
- Better tracking of navigation routes

### 3. `app/src/main/java/com/deeksha/avr/ui/view/productionhead/ProductionHeadMainScreen.kt`
- Fixed `onNavigateToEditProject` parameter issue
- Updated navigation icons (Folder and People)
- Removed unnecessary tonal elevation

### 4. `app/src/main/java/com/deeksha/avr/ui/view/productionhead/ProductionHeadProjectsTab.kt`
- Added `onNavigateToEditProject` parameter
- Made edit button clickable
- Updated to match iOS design

## How It Works Now

1. **User enters phone number** in login screen
2. **Clicks development skip button**
3. **Code clears any previous auth state** (including Firebase)
4. **Fetches user from Firestore** by phone number
5. **Logs the detected role** with detailed information
6. **Sets authenticated state** with correct role
7. **Navigates based on role**:
   - `USER` ‚Üí Project Selection screen
   - `APPROVER` ‚Üí Approver Project Selection screen
   - `PRODUCTION_HEAD` ‚Üí Production Head Dashboard
   - `ADMIN` ‚Üí Admin Dashboard

## Testing

### To Test Fix:
1. **Log out completely** from the app (if logged in)
2. **Clear app data** (optional, but recommended)
3. Enter phone number **6360090611**
4. Click **Development Skip** button
5. Check Logcat for role detection:
   ```
   adb logcat -s AuthViewModel AppNavHost -d
   ```
6. Verify correct screen is shown based on role

### Expected Logcat Output:
```
AuthViewModel: üßπ Clearing previous authentication state
AuthViewModel: ‚úÖ Firebase auth cleared
AuthViewModel: ‚úÖ Found actual user in database
AuthViewModel:    Name: Manya 
AuthViewModel:    Role from DB: USER
AuthViewModel:    Role value: USER
AuthViewModel: ‚úÖ Development skip successful: Manya  (USER)
AuthViewModel: üöÄ Calling navigation callback with role: USER
AppNavHost: üéØ Processing role navigation for role: USER
AppNavHost: üéØ Navigating USER to ProjectSelection route: project_selection
```

## Verification Steps

1. **For USER role (6360090611):**
   - Should navigate to "project_selection" 
   - Should show regular user project selection screen

2. **For APPROVER role:**
   - Should navigate to "approver_project_selection"
   - Should show approver project selection screen

3. **For PRODUCTION_HEAD role:**
   - Should navigate to "production_head_dashboard"
   - Should show Production Head screen with Projects and User Management tabs

## Production Considerations

### Remove Development Skip in Production:
The development skip functionality should be **removed** or **disabled** for production builds. Add this check:

```kotlin
// In LoginScreen.kt
val isDebugBuild = BuildConfig.DEBUG

if (isDebugBuild) {
    // Show development skip button
}
```

## Summary

‚úÖ **Fixed:** Cached authentication state issue
‚úÖ **Fixed:** Role-based navigation for all user types
‚úÖ **Enhanced:** Detailed logging for debugging
‚úÖ **Improved:** State management during development skip
‚úÖ **Updated:** Edit project functionality
‚úÖ **Updated:** Production Head UI to match iOS design

The app now correctly routes users based on their role from Firestore, regardless of previous login sessions.
